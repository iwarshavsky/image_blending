This was an exercise I did in Image Processing. It had two goals:
1.	Given two images create a hybrid image out of them.
2.	Given two images and a mask, blend the images seamlessly in such a way that in the new image, the area where the black part overlaps the first image only it will be prominent and where the white part of the mask overlaps the second image only it will be prominent.

The report explaining the process is attached as a PDF file.

These were the sample images I used.
<p float="left">
  <img src="./1.png?raw=true" width="49%" />
  <img src="./2.png?raw=true" width="49%"/>
</p>

These were my results:
<h2>Hybrid image creation:</h2>
<p float="left">
  <img src="./result_hybrid.png?raw=true" />
</p>
<h2>Blended image creation:</h2>
<p float="left">
  <img src="./result_blending.png?raw=true" />
</p>
